Importing the fmt Package:
The code starts by importing the fmt package, which provides functions for formatting and printing output.

Defining a Shortcut for fmt.Println:
The line var pf = fmt.Println creates a shortcut for fmt.Println, allowing it to be used as pf instead of fmt.Println.
 This is a common practice to reduce the amount of code needed for printing.

Defining a Type Constraint:
The line type My_Constraint interface { int | float64 } defines a type constraint named My_Constraint. 
This constraint specifies that the type must be either int or float64.

Defining a Generic Function:
The function get_sum_gen is defined with a type parameter T that is constrained to My_Constraint. 
This means T can be either int or float64.

The function takes two arguments of type T and returns their sum.

Main Function:
The main function is the entry point of the program.

It uses the pf shortcut to print the results of calling get_sum_gen with different types of arguments:
get_sum_gen(5, 4) adds two int values and prints the result.

get_sum_gen(23.45, 6.55) adds two float64 values and prints the result.

When you run this code, it will output:
 5 + 4 : 9
 23.45 + 6.55 : 30

This demonstrates how the generic function get_sum_gen can work with different types, as long as they satisfy the type constraint.
