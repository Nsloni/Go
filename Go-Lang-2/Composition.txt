Defining the contact Struct:
The code defines a contact struct with three fields: fname, lname, and phone, all of type string. 
These fields represent the first name, last name, and phone number of a contact.

Defining the business Struct:
The code defines a business struct with three fields: name, address, and contact.
 The contact field is of type contact, which means a business struct can hold a contact struct.

Defining the info Method:
The info method is defined on the business struct. It takes no arguments other than the receiver b of type business.

The method uses fmt.Printf to print a formatted string containing the business name, contact first name, and contact last name.

Main Function:
The main function is the entry point of the program.

It creates a contact instance con_1 with a first name, last name, and phone number.

It creates a business instance bus_1 with a name, address, and the con_1 contact.

It calls the info method on bus_1 to print the contact information.

When you run this code, it will output:

Contact at : ABC Planning is NSLONI LONI

This demonstrates how to define structs and methods in Go, and how to use them to perform operations and print information.
