package main:
This line declares that the file is part of the main package. In Go, every file must start with a package declaration.

import ( "fmt" "unicode/utf8" ):
This line imports the necessary packages for the program. The fmt package is used for formatting and printing output, 
and the unicode/utf8 package is used for working with Unicode characters.

func main() { ... }:
This line declares the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
 The code inside the main function will be executed when the program runs.

user_name := "NAGARAJ_nagaraj":
This line declares a variable user_name and assigns it the string "NAGARAJ_nagaraj".

fmt.Println("Runes Count: ", utf8.RuneCountInString(user_name)):
This line uses the fmt.Println function to print the number of runes (Unicode characters) in the user_name string.
 The utf8.RuneCountInString function is used to count the runes.

for i, runes := range user_name { ... }:
This line starts a for loop that iterates over the runes in the user_name string. 
The range keyword is used to iterate over the string, and the loop variables are i (the index) and runes (the rune value).

fmt.Printf("%d : %#U : %c\n", i, runes, runes):
This line uses the fmt.Printf function to print information about each rune.
 The format string "%d : %#U : %c\n" specifies the format of the output:

%d is the index i.

%#U is the Unicode code point of the rune in hexadecimal notation.

%c is the character represented by the rune.

The output of this program will be a list of the runes in the user_name string, along with their indices and Unicode code points.
