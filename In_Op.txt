
1. package main: This line declares that this file is a Go program's main package.

2. import ( "bufio" "fmt" "log" "os" ): This line imports four packages:
    - bufio: For buffered input.
    - fmt: For formatted input/output.
    - log: For logging errors.
    - os: For operating system-specific functionality.

3. var pf = fmt.Println: This line creates a shortcut variable pf for the fmt.Println function.

4. func main() { ... }: This is the main function, which is the entry point of the program.

5. pf("Hell, What is Your Name: "): This line prints the message "Hell, What is Your Name: " using the shortcut variable pf.

6. reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin): This line creates a new reader that reads from the standard input (os.Stdin).

7. name, err := reader.ReadString('\n'): This line reads a string from the input until a newline character ('\n') is encountered.
 The result is stored in the name variable, and any error is stored in the err variable.

8. if err == nil { pf("Hello", name) } else { log.Fatal(err) }: If there's no error, it prints "Hello" followed by the user's input.
 If there's an error, it logs the error using log.Fatal.

In summary, this program prompts the user for their name, reads the input, and then prints a personalized greeting message. 
If there's an error during input, it logs the error.
